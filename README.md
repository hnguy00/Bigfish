# Energy Usage Data Randomization and Visualization

This project aims to randomize energy usage data for households in specific locations and visualize the data using scatter plots. It provides a tool to generate synthetic energy usage data for analysis and visualization purposes.
This is a project built for the event Builders Weekend, June 2-4, 2023 in Tokyo.

## Features

- Randomize energy usage data for households in specified locations.
- Generate synthetic energy usage values based on predefined patterns.
- Visualize the randomized data using scatter plots.
- Customize the scatter plot appearance and labels.
- Save the generated data and scatter plots for further analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Plotly library
- Seaborn library
- Sendgrid API

## Usage

1. Modify the `merged_data.rar` file to view and the data, the desired household, locations.
2. Run the `gen_dataset(2).ipynb` script to randomize the energy usage data.
3. Customize the scatter plot appearance/labels to generate scatter plots in the `visual.ipynb` script.
5. Run `script.py` to set up automatic email sendouts via Sendgrid API.

## Examples

Download Dashboard(1).html and check the demo of the scatter plot.
