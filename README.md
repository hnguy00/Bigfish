# Energy Usage Data Randomization and Visualization

This project aims to randomize energy usage data for households in specific locations and visualize the data using scatter plots. It provides a tool to generate synthetic energy usage data for analysis and visualization purposes.

## Features

- Randomize energy usage data for households in specified locations.
- Generate synthetic energy usage values based on predefined patterns.
- Visualize the randomized data using scatter plots.
- Customize the scatter plot appearance and labels.
- Save the generated data and scatter plots for further analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Plotly library
- Seaborn library
- Sendgrid API

## Usage

1. Modify the `merged_data file to include the desired household locations.
2. Run the `randomize_data.py` script to randomize the energy usage data: `python randomize_data.py`.
3. Customize the scatter plot appearance and labels in the `visualize_data.py` script.
4. Run the `visualize_data.py` script to generate scatter plots: `python visualize_data.py`.
